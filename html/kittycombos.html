                    As our final project for ISIT 320, we in Human Systems worked together to create a website centered around Kitty Combos, a cat-themed tile-matching game similar to popular games like Bejeweled and Candy Crush.<br /><br />

                    Upon the player starting the game, an 8x8 grid of random cat images is generated. Five cat images are pulled from a random cat image API, so players will see new images every time they play.
                    <img src="../img/kittyCombosBoard.JPG" alt="A picture of the Kitty Combos board." style="max-width: 25%; height: auto; float: left; padding: 0 20px 20px 0; margin: 10px;"> <br /><br />
                    Displayed here is an example of a randomly generated board. <br /><br />

                    The player starts out with 15 turns and 0 points. Swapping two adjacent tiles to make a match decreases their turn counter, and making large tile combinations rewards the player with extra turns. Large tile combinations also give a higher number of points than the basic 3-tile combination, so the player is heavily incentivized to search for them.<br /><br />

                    The player's main goal is to earn as many points as possible before running out of turns. Once this happens, they will be shown their final score and an online leaderboard that records and displays the game's top scores.<br /><br />

                    (Detail responsibilities during the documentation phase. What work I did to help the team as a whole, and keep us all on the same page in our documents / diagrams.)<br /><br />
                    
                    Once we reached the development phase of the project, the JavaScript around Kitty Combo's game logic was my responsibility. So far, the portions I have created that I am the most proud of are the board generation, tile interactability, match recognition / removal, and "tile fall" features.<br /><br />

                    (Detail on what the project helped me learn / what strengths were gained. I became more familiar with the creation of project documentation, as well as what is important when working in a group. I have always tended to work by myself, and I realize that working with others is a vital skill to have, especially in the software development field that I hope to enter.)<br /><br />

                    (Detail on what advice I would give to someone who is about to do a similar project of their own.)
