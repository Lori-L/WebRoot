          <a target="_blank" href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Validator</a><br />
          The W3C validator checks the formatting of a website to ensure that it meets W3C standards. 
          If any issues are present, it locates and describes them, along with why they are issues in the first place.<br />
          The W3C validator is a great resource for anybody new to HTML. It allows for quick and concise feedback, 
          which is incredibly helpful for anyone who is still becoming familiar with HTML standards and best practices.<br />

          <a target="_blank" href="https://web.dev/">web.dev</a><br />
          The web.dev site is an instructional website put together by Chrome developers.
          There are many courses that help walk you through different aspects of web development.<br />
          The one I'm reading through right now is for <a target="_blank" href="https://web.dev/learn/design/">responsive design.</a>
          Although I'm still earlier on in the course, it has already explained and clarified some things I was confused on.
          The explanations are good, and it also walks through example code while explaining each step, which has been very helpful to me so far.

          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codecademy.com/">CodeCademy</a><br />
          CodeCademy provides courses in a variety of languages at directed towards varying proficiency levels.<br />
          The courses themselves are informative, allowing you to play with the code and see its results immediately.
          Tips and hints are given based on the type of mistakes made, which help prevent any missing backslash-induced frustations from growing.
          Learning is also gamified, with each day of engagement being measured, and multi-day streaks celebrated.
          Unfortunately, though, most content (especially the higher-level content) on this website is locked behind CodeCademy Pro,
          which does have a subscription fee.<br />

        <p id="d">
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a><br />
          On YouTube, anybody can create and upload videos for others to see. Tips and tutorials are easy to find for a variety of different skills,
          as long as you know what you're looking for.<br />
          Some fantastic resources can be found on YouTube, if you are willing to dig for a little bit.
          The difficulty comes in differentiating the well-made tutorials from the inaccurate and unhelpful ones - 
          many videos claim to hold life-changing information, but are only trying to get more views.
          This can lead to wasted time that could have been spent learning and growing.
          Here are some good resources that I have found especially helpful: 
          <ul>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/programmingwithmosh">Programming with Mosh</a></li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified">Web Dev Simplified</a></li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azcrPFhaY9k">Video: How To Think Like A Programmer</a></li>

          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">FreeCodeCamp</a><br />
          FreeCodeCamp has thousands of coding tutorials spanning many different programming languages for, well, free!<br />
          They also have a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp">YouTube channel</a> that uploads tutorials frequently.
          There are many informative articles, as well - for example, I refreshed my memory on how to make links open in a new tab using
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-open-a-link-in-a-new-tab/">this article!</a>
          It is difficult to stumble across an article that you haven't specifically searched for, though.
          This week, in an attempt to become more familiar with responsive web design, I started their Responsive Web Design Certification course.
          Although I am still very early in the course, the descriptions are thorough and easily understandable.<br />
